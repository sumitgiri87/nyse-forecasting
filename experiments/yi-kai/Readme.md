## Rationale and Recent Update 

### Question to Answer: 

`**Predict the next day price by giving a specific input**` 

### 🧠 Rationale: 

- "Most of the business problems are not ML problems, and most of the ML problems are not business problems" from Production Lecture Day 1 : 36:58.
  - Optimizing an ML model is not the same thing as optimizing a business problem. 

- ML system: Learn automatically and gain from the experience (*the experience: in plain English, more data, more observation*); however, more data or experience does not necessarily guarantee better performance.

- **The 80/20 rule**: Roughly 80% of outcomes result from 20% of causes or inputs. Therefore, to have the model predict with a reasonable confidence level, we only need to capture the 20% the most important information or patterns.   



### 🧭 🗺️ Current Roadmap:

This idea here is focuses on isolating core predictive patterns rather than modeling every variable. The goal is to extract essential signals using available and ready to use algorithms by adopting the 80/20 rules — to keep the model both interpretable and computationally efficient.

  1. Quick test of available common stock models (ARIMA, LSTM, etc.) with representive stocks (AAPL, INTC, MSFT) ✅  

  2. Assess the baseline performance using randomness robustness, regression, residual analysis (Test 1 to Test 6)✅  
  
  3. Tuning by featuring engineering (`close_price`, `return_7d`,`streak_up`, `streak_down`,`range_ratio`) and re-assess the tuned model for randomness robustness (Test 7, 8, 9)✅  
  
  4. Applying the same approach to the same sectors"TBD/exploratory?(TBD)”
  
      - Selecting indicator stocks (TBD)  

      - Exploring AutoML for automation for tuning on hyperparameters (TBD)

  5. UMAP-based analysis for poor performers (TBD) 
   .....  
   .....  
  X. Scale-up to other sectors?(TBD)    



### Update log:

## Experiment Note:
> [!Note]  
> 1. Test 1 to Test 3: quick test of ARIMA and LSTM using AAPL, INTC, and MSFT.
> 
> 2. Test 4: Further deep dive into ARIMA, no good result ❎.
> 
> 3. **Test 5**: Further deep dive into TSTM, interesting results. Testing model randomness robustness (**same random seed x 3 runs**), testing the concept of prediction of the next day closing price using the last 20-day closing price.  
> 
> 4. **Test 6**: Further deep dive into TSTM, interesting results. Testing model randomness robustness (**three different random seed x 3 runs**), testing the concept of prediction of the next day closing price using the last 20-day closing price. 
> 
> 5. **Test 7 to Test 9**: Adding extra **feature engineering** (6 features total) to increase the model stability and testing the robustness with APPL, INTC, and MSTF.
